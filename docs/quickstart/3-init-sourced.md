# Run source{d} CE

_For the full list of the sub-commands offered by `sourced`, please take a look at_ [_the `sourced` sub-commands inventory_](../usage/commands.md)_._

**source{d} CE** can be initialized from 2 different data sources: GitHub organizations, or local Git repositories.

Please note that you have to choose one data source to initialize **source{d} CE**, but you can have more than one isolated environment, and they can have different sources. See the guide about [Working With Multiple Data Sets](../usage/multiple-datasets.md) for more details.

**source{d} CE** will download and install Docker images on demand. Therefore, the first time you run some of these commands, they might take a bit of time to start up. Subsequent runs will be faster.

## From GitHub Organizations

When using GitHub organizations to populate the **source{d} CE** database you only need to provide a list of organization names and a [GitHub personal access token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/). If no scope is granted to the user token, only public data will be fetched. To let **source{d} CE** access also private repositories and hidden users, the token should have the following scopes enabled:

* `repo` Full control of private repositories
* `read:org` Read org and team membership, read org projects

Use this command to initialize, e.g.

```text
$ sourced init orgs --token <token> src-d,bblfsh
```

It will also download, in the background, the repositories of the passed GitHub organizations, and their metadata: pull requests, issues, users...

## From Local Repositories

```text
$ sourced init local </path/to/repositories>
```

It will initialize **source{d} CE** to analyze the git repositories under the passed path, or under the current directory if no one is passed. The repositories will be found recursively.

**Note for macOS:** Docker for Mac [requires enabling file sharing](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/troubleshoot/#volume-mounting-requires-file-sharing-for-any-project-directories-outside-of-users) for any path outside of `/Users`.

**Note for Windows:** Docker for Windows [requires shared drives](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#shared-drives). Other than that, it's important to use a working directory that doesn't include any sub-directory whose access is not readable by the user running `sourced`. For example, using `C:\Users` as workdir, will most probably not work. For more details see [this issue](https://github.com/src-d/engine/issues/250).

## What's Next?

Once **source{d} CE** has been initialized, it will automatically open the web UI. If the UI is not opened automatically, you can use `sourced web` command, or visit [http://127.0.0.1:8088](http://127.0.0.1:8088).

Use login: `admin` and password: `admin`, to access the web interface.
