## Where Can I Find More Assistance to Run source{d} or Notify You About Any Issue or Suggestion?

_If you're dealing with an error or something that you think that can be caused by an unexpected error, please refer to our_ [_Troubleshooting guide_](troubleshooting.md)_. With the info that you can obtain following those steps, you could fix the problem or you will be able to explain it better in the following channels:_

* [open an issue](https://github.com/src-d/sourced-ce/issues), if you want to

  suggest a new feature, if you need assistance with a contribution, or if you

  found any bug.

* [Visit the source{d} Forum](https://forum.sourced.tech) where users and community

  members discuss anything source{d} related. You will find there some common questions

  from other source{d} users, or ask yours.

* [join our community on Slack](https://sourced-community.slack.com/join/shared_invite/enQtMjc4Njk5MzEyNzM2LTFjNzY4NjEwZGEwMzRiNTM4MzRlMzQ4MmIzZjkwZmZlM2NjODUxZmJjNDI1OTcxNDAyMmZlNmFjODZlNTg0YWM),

## How Can I Update My Version Of source{d} CE?

When there is a new release of **source{d} CE**, it is noticed every time a `sourced` command is called. When it happens you can download the new version from [src-d/sourced-ce/releases/latest](https://github.com/src-d/sourced-ce/releases/latest), and proceed as it follows:

\(You can also follow these steps if you want to update to any beta version, to downgrade, or to use your own built version of **source{d} CE**\)

1. download the new binary for your OS
2. move the binary to the right place \([see Quickstart. Install](../quickstart/2-install-sourced.md)\)
3. run `sourced compose download`
4. run `sourced restart` to apply the new configuration.

This process will reinstall **source{d} CE** with the new components, but it will keep your data \(repositories, charts, dashboards, etc\). If you want to replace all the current dashboards with the ones from the release that you just installed, you have two alternatives:

* run `sourced prune --all` before running `sourced init`; but if you were using

  repositories downloaded from a GitHub organization, they will be deleted, and

  downloaded again.

* drop only the dashboards, and load the new ones, following also this other

  instructions: [How To Restore Dashboards and Charts to Defaults](faq.md#how-to-restore-dashboards-and-charts-to-defaults)

## How To Restore Dashboards and Charts to Defaults

In some circumstances, you may want to restore the UI dashboard and charts to its defaults. Currently, there is no clean way of doing it without deleting all the state of the UI.

Following these steps, all the state modified from the UI \(charts, dashboards, saved queries, users, roles, etcetera\) will be replaced by the default ones for the version of **source{d} CE** that you're currently using. If you're using repositories from a GitHub organization, all its data will be preserved, and only charts and dashboards will be restarted.

To do so, you only need to delete the docker volume containing the PostgreSQL database, and restart **source{d} CE**. It can be done following these steps if you already have [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed:

```text
$ cd ~/.sourced/workdirs/__active__
$ source .env
$ docker-compose stop postgres
$ docker-compose rm -f postgres
$ ENV_PREFIX=`awk '{print tolower($0)}' <<< ${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME}`
$ docker volume rm ${ENV_PREFIX}_postgres
$ docker-compose up -d postgres
$ docker-compose exec -u superset sourced-ui bash -c 'sleep 10s && python bootstrap.py'
```

## How to Update the Data from the Organizations Being Analyzed

There is no way to update imported data, and [when a scraper is restarted](troubleshooting.md#how-can-i-restart-one-scraper), it procedes as it follows:

### gitcollector

Organizations and repositories are downloaded independently, so if they fail, the process is not stopped until all the organizations and repositories have been iterated.

If `gitcollector` is restarted, it will download more repositories, but it wonâ€™t update any of the already existent ones. You can see the progress of the new process in the welcome dashboard; since already existent repositories won't be updated, those will appear as `failed` in progress status.

### ghsync

The way how metadata is imported by `ghsync` is a bit different, and it is done sequentially per each organization, so if any step fails, the whole importation will fail.

Pull requests, issues, and users of the same organization, are imported in that order in separate transaction each one, and if one transaction fails, the process will be stopped so the next ones won't be processed.

Once the three different entities have been imported, the organization will be considered as "done", and restarting `ghsync` won't cause to update its data.

If `ghsync` is restarted, it will only import data from organizations that could not be finished considering the rules explained above. The process of `ghsync` will be updated in the welcome dashboard and if an organization was already imported, it will appear as "nothing imported" in the status chart.

## Can I Query Gitbase or Babelfish with External Tools?

Yes, as explained in our docs about [**source{d} CE** Architecture](architecture.md#docker-networking), these and other components are exposed to the host machine, to be used by third party tools like [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/), [gitbase clients](https://docs.sourced.tech/gitbase/using-gitbase/supported-clients) and [Babelfish clients](https://docs.sourced.tech/babelfish/using-babelfish/clients).

The connection values that you should use to connect to these components, are defined in the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/dpordomingo/sourced-ce/tree/a58c517aa6247630cba917ac9b86955d8a0e787b/docker-compose.yml), and sumarized in the [Architecture documentation](architecture.md#docker-networking)

## Where Can I Read More About the Web Interface?

The user interface is based in the open-sourced [Apache Superset](http://superset.apache.org), so you can also refer to [Superset tutorials](http://superset.apache.org/tutorial.html) for advanced usage of the web interface.
